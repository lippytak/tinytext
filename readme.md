# TinyText
**TinyText is dead simple Q&A over text message.**

Basically it lets you text a bunch of people at once and get answers right away. The goal is to give small nonprofits an easy way to get feedback from clients. You can use it to...

Help you make a quick decision:
> 'Should our next workshop cover tax preparation or health insurnace?'

Send time sensitive alerts:
> Don't forget that the school enrollment form is due next Friday! Need help? Call me!

Get feedback:
> Was our last workshop helpful to you? Reply with 1-5 where 1=not at all and 5=very helpful (Be honest! Don't worry we can take it!)

Just check in to maintain long term relationships:
> Hey this is Jake from the Food Bank. I remember we got you enrolled in a pantry last month. How is it going? Anything I can do to help today?

Get young people to read your messages:
> Hello class this is Mrs. Teacher! Don't forget your boring research assignment is due Wednesday. Do you need a one day extension?

Collect data:
> March is almost over! How much money were you able to save this month?

You can get up and running in **two minutes or less**, we gaurantee it.
